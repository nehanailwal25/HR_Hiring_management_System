# HR_Hiring_management_System

This Whole project focuses on solving the issues faced in the Hiring process of any organisation. 

#### Problem Statement: 
Whenever a person goes for an Interview in a company, a lot of steps are followed in the whole recruitment process, that usually start with HR initiating the process like finding the perfect job match, putting the data into the System. Then the candidate is eventually led to a few rounds of interviews, and once the whole process is completed, the status goes back to HR for further steps. 
This whole process is a lengthy one, and a lot of things must be taken care, mainly this process involves a lot of paperwork. Paperwork means an increased no. of threats to data as information can be lost, manipulated, etc., wherever some work related to the filing of the progress oh a candidate in the Recruitment process comes up, that has to be taken care of by the HRâ€™s in mostly all the scenarios, hence becoming centralized and leads to more work to be done by just one person in the whole process.


#### Solution implemented: 
The proposed solution in this project focuses on resolving all these issues by making the System decentralized, with which all the participants in the whole hiring process for the Employee can Enter the related data (according to their Authorization) and this way, the process would be made easier and faster.
No one will hold the central authority of the process, but everyone will be a part of it and will be authorized to do their own part of the recruitment process only. Hence, improving the process and making it faster than the manual one.
